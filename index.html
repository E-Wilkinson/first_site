<p>Hi, I am Eleanor.  I am 23 years old and I work in Public Relations for a public sector body called <a href="https//:www.english-heritage.org.uk">English Heritage.</a>  This is the organisation that advises the government on its policy towards the built environment, like which buildings to list and what planning applications to accept.  It also looks after tourist sites like Stonehenge. That is its more famous (but much less interesting) role.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I am learning two creative skills.  I am learning to code, and I am also taking lessons on how to do pottery on the wheel.  They might seem very different and incompatible, but I like to see coding as a kind of digital pottery! Ultimately, you ar creating something that can be used in your everyday life.</p>

<p>I didn't have the most conventional childhood ever.  My dad was in the foreign office and was posted all around the world, so I ended up spending 3 years living in Venezuela and going to a local Venezuelan school.</p>
